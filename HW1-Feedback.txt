Homework Assignment #1
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
======================

NOTE:  THIS WAS A GROUP ASSIGNMENT, FOR WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN
   TOGETHER TO READ AND THEN DISCUSS THE ARTICLE.  REMEMBER THAT YOU COULD
   HAVE PICKED ANY ARTICLE YOU LIKED TO USE FOR THE ASSIGNMENT.  I PICKED
   ONE ENTRY TO EVALUATE AND DID NOT PROVIDE EVALUATIONS FOR ALL FOUR OF
   THE SUBMISSIONS.  I TRIED TO PICK THE 'BEST' OF THE FOUR SO THAT YOUR
   GROUP SCORE WOULD BE THE HIGHEST.  I THINK IT WAS OK THIS WAY SINCE YOU
   GOT 100%....

   I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU ALL DID THE WORK ON THIS ASSIGNMENT, AND THE
   ESSAYS ARE ALL GOOD, SO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PICK JUST ONE TO DO THE
   EVALUATION.

SUMMARY:
The essay provides a clear and accurate summary of the ValuJet Flight 592
crash, including the timeline, technical cause (improperly stored oxygen
generators), and the systemic failures that led to the disaster.

The essay effectively explains the concept of a "system accident" and how
the crash resulted from a chain of small, interconnected failures. It
highlights the roles of SabreTech, ValuJet, and the FAA.

The essay includes specific and relevant details, such as the missing
safety caps, mislabeling of hazardous materials, and the lack of fire
suppression systems.

The writing is clear, well-organized, and logically structured. The
narrative flows smoothly from the incident to the broader systemic issues.

The essay reflects on the broader implications of the crash, particularly
the dangers of diffused responsibility and the limitations of regulatory
oversight in complex systems.

Overall: The synopsis is comprehensive, well-supported, and critically
engaged, effectively capturing the article’s key arguments and deeper
insights.

CRITICAL THINKING:
The essay draws strong and relevant parallels between the ValuJet disaster
and software engineering, especially in areas like system complexity,
third-party dependencies, and organizational responsibility.

The essay insightfully connects the ValuJet case to software engineering
challenges, such as ambiguous ownership, communication breakdowns, and the
risks of cutting corners under pressure.

The essay references key practices such as defense-in-depth, layered
validation, monitoring, clear ownership, and cross-team communication. It
also emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety over speed.

The examples are grounded in real-world software development scenarios. The
recommendations are practical and align with industry best practices.

The writing is articulate and logically structured. Each point is
well-developed and transitions smoothly into the next. The tone is
professional and reflective.

Overall: The application to software engineering is thoughtful, technically
grounded, and highly relevant, demonstrating a strong understanding of how
systemic failures in aviation can inform better practices in software
development.

   Total Percentage:   100 out of 100 which is an A-plus

This essay is a well-structured and insightful analysis that effectively
connects the ValuJet Flight 592 disaster to software engineering. It
demonstrates a strong grasp of systemic risk, the importance of clear
ownership and communication, and the need for robust safety practices in
complex systems.

Strengths:
Accurate and detailed summary of the article.
Strong analogies between aviation and software engineering.
Emphasis on observability, safety protocols, and organizational
   responsibility.
Clear writing and logical structure.

Suggestions for Improvement:
A brief concluding paragraph summarizing the key takeaways from both
   sections would enhance cohesion.
Including a real-world software failure (e.g., the Boeing 737 MAX MCAS
   issue or the Knight Capital glitch) could further strengthen the application
   section.
