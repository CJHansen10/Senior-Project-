problem 2, Mostly correct, though standard Agile phases are requirements,
   design, implementation, testing, and review.  While initial planning
   helps, repeating phases ensures adaptability and prevents costly
   rework.

problem 6, Incorrect for second blank (User Story instead of Estimate) and
   last blank (Blueskying instead of Planning Poker).

Your answers are well-structured, accurate, and demonstrate strong
   understanding of Agile, Waterfall, estimation, and practical tools.  Most
   responses are complete and reasoned, with good examples.  Minor
   improvements include correcting Problem 6 and aligning Agile phases with
   standard terminology.  Overall, this is an excellent submission that
   meets all requirements and shows clear engagement with the material.

nice work!
