Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Unnamed fighting game
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
I don't see a proposal document in your repository, as is required by this
deliverable assignment.  I can't evaluate what isn't there!  :D  Please make
a document per the specifications and put it into your repository ASAP and
the points for this will be restored.

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  I like your
graphics, and the slide background coloring is very eye-catching!

Overall, very good!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

2 out of 5 which is not the best on this deliverable.  Make sure that you do
the proposal document and commit that for restoration of points ASAP.
