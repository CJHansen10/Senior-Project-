Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Unnamed fighting game
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
I don't see a proposal document in your repository, as is required by this
deliverable assignment.  I can't evaluate what isn't there!  :D  Please make
a document per the specifications and put it into your repository ASAP and
the points for this will be restored.

RE-EVALUATED AFTER BEING INFORMED THAT DOCUMENT IS IN README FILE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
OK, sorry about that.

The description of what you are planning is VERY VERY complete!  The team has
obviously put a lot of thought into this project and you have a good listing
and good descriptions of what the parts are and what you'll do with them.  I
like the idea of pirates [ARGH!] and I think this well be fun for players to
engage with.  You have listed several existing games as exemplars, which is
good to give context to the reader.  You have also listed your long-term
goals, so the reader knows the extended plan.  Very nice up to this point.

However, you DON'T have the required 'justification' section.  This was part
of the specification for the document.  It should explain why your team's
choice of project is appropriate for this class.  The following criteria
should be considered in writing the justification:
  * The project applies and demonstrates what team members have learned in
      other classes
  * The project gives each team member the opportunity to extend what s/he
      has learned in other classes
  * The technical difficulty of the project is appropriate (not too easy,
      not too difficult)
  * One semester is a reasonable amount of time to develop the project
  * The team as a whole possesses the tools required to complete the project
  * The project is interesting to each teammate, classmates, and the instructor


Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  I like your
graphics, and the slide background coloring is very eye-catching!

Overall, very good!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

4 out of 5 which is a B on this deliverable.
