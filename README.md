# Senior-Project-
Concept Overview

We aim to create a simple, approachable fighting platform game that caters to both casual players and those who may not typically play video games. Our goal is to offer:

Simple controls

Straightforward gameplay mechanics

An ocean-themed world filled with pirate captains as fighters

This approach ensures low entry barriers while still providing enough depth for players to improve and master the game over time.

Inspiration & Genre Context

We draw inspiration from popular games within the fighting and party platform genre, such as:

Super Smash Bros.

Street Fighter

Tekken

Boomerang Fu

While games like Smash Bros. are beloved, they often feature complex mechanics and hidden systems that can overwhelm new players. We want to blend simplicity with satisfying gameplay by adopting core features from these titles, especially the minimal yet engaging controls of Boomerang Fu (e.g., slash, throw, dash).
