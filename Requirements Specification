5.0  Requirements Specification
               5.1      Introduction
                  Pirate Fighters is a 2D, controller-friendly pirate fighting game designed for accessibility and quick fun, even for players who don’t typically game. 
                  At a high level, the system centers on a Unity client that delivers core features—a Title/Menu with login/logout, character movement/combat/block/jump, multiple arena maps, special-move logic, 
                  audio/FX, and local save/profile management—fed by an asset pipeline (Blender + GIMP) and supported by standard dev tooling (Visual Studio, Git/GitHub). 
                  The target execution platform is Windows PCs that meet the listed minimums. Implementation details, user stories, and operational context are deferred to the ConOps and companion documents; 
                  this section only frames the system and its components.
