=======================================

INTRODUCTION SECTION:
   System objectives section
   Hardware, software, and human interfaces section
Strengths
   Clear subsystem breakdown: The document identifies six major subsystems
      (UI, State Control, Input & Player Management, Player Control,
      Physics & Collision, Content & Assets), each with scope,
      responsibilities, and functional requirement mappings.
   Traceability: The mapping of functional requirements (FR 5.2.x) to
      subsystems is thorough and explicit, ensuring coverage and
      accountability.
   Low coupling: The design emphasizes narrow, directed interactions between
      components, which supports modularity and testability.
   Unity-specific clarity: The use of Unity components (e.g., PlayerInput,
      SceneLoader, EventSystem) is well-documented, showing practical
      integration with the engine.
Suggestions
   Add diagrams inline or reference them more clearly: While the document
      mentions that diagrams are in a separate document, a placeholder or
      summary of what each diagram shows would improve readability and
      completeness.
   Include rationale for architectural choices: While the design is clean, a
      brief justification for why certain patterns (e.g., static GameState,
      prefab-based composition) were chosen would enhance understanding.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major softwre components section
      Strengths
         Subsystem-centric organization: Each component is grouped logically
            under its subsystem, with clear responsibilities and mappings to
            functional requirements.
         Unity integration: The use of Unity-specific systems
            (e.g., InputSystemUIInputModule, PlayerInputManager) is
            well-explained.
         Scalability considerations: The document notes prototype constraints
            (e.g., 2 players) and how the design can scale to 6 players.
      Suggestions
         Add component diagrams or class relationships: Visualizing how
            components relate (e.g., inheritance, composition) would help
            clarify the architecture.
         Expand on error handling: While some edge cases are mentioned, a more
            systematic approach to error handling across components (e.g.,
               what happens if PlayerInputManager fails to spawn a player?)
               would strengthen robustness.
   Major software interactions section
      Strengths
         Runtime flow clarity: The document clearly explains how data and
            control flow between subsystems during runtime.
         Separation of concerns: UI input and gameplay input are distinctly
            separated, which is a best practice in game development.
         Interaction summaries: Each interaction (e.g., UI, State, Scene,
            Player Join & Device Pairing) is described with purpose, flow,
            and Unity API usage.
      Suggestions
         Add sequence diagrams or flowcharts: These would visually reinforce
            the described interactions and help readers quickly grasp the flow.
         Clarify external API dependencies: While Unity APIs are listed, a
            brief note on version compatibility or known limitations would be
               helpful for maintainability.
   Architectural design diagrams section
      Strengths
         The document acknowledges the importance of diagrams and states they
            are in a separate document.
      Suggestions
         Include diagram summaries or thumbnails: Even if the full diagrams
            are in another document, a brief description or reference to their
            content (e.g., "Figure 1: UI Flow", "Figure 2: Player Join Sequence")
            would improve completeness.
         Ensure diagrams match described interactions: When reviewing the
            separate diagram document, verify that it aligns with the
            interactions and components described in 6.2 and 6.2.2.

Overall Completeness Assessment
The document is highly complete at the architectural design level for an
   Agile or Waterfall SDD. It:
      Covers all required sections with depth.
      Maps functional requirements to components.
      Describes runtime interactions and subsystem responsibilities.
      Uses Unity-specific terminology and APIs effectively.

Nice job ~ on to the detailed design!
