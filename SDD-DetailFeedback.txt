==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      Clear CSC breakdown: The document identifies six Component Subsystems
         (CSCs), each with a well-defined purpose and associated Component
         Subsystem Units (CSUs).
      Unity-specific clarity: The use of Unity components
         (e.g., PlayerInputManager, SceneLoader, CharacterSelectController)
         is well-integrated and explained.
      Scalability awareness: Notes on scalability (e.g., 2 to 6 players) are
         present, showing foresight in design.
   Suggestions
      Add rationale for CSU grouping: While the CSCs are well-organized, a
         brief explanation of why certain CSUs are grouped together would
         help clarify design decisions.
      Include more lightweight scene scripts: The document mentions
         lightweight scripts for Main Menu and Player Count but doesn't
            detail them. Even brief outlines would improve completeness.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      Comprehensive coverage: Each class includes purpose, fields, methods,
         and behavioral descriptions.
      Unity lifecycle awareness: Methods like Awake, OnEnable, FixedUpdate,
         and Update are clearly described with their roles.
      Input handling clarity: The PlayercontroledInput class shows excellent
         detail in how input actions are resolved and used.
   Suggestions
      Add access modifiers: While fields and methods are listed, specifying
         public, private, or protected would clarify encapsulation.
      Include class relationships: Mentioning inheritance or composition
         (e.g., which classes use or extend others) would help understand
         the object model.
      Expand on error handling: Some classes (e.g., PlayerJoinHandler) could
         benefit from notes on how they handle unexpected states or failures.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      Clarifies subsystem communication: The section explains how CSUs
         interact, focusing on control and data flow.
      Avoids confusion with language-specific interfaces: The document
         correctly clarifies that “interface” refers to interaction points,
         not Java/C# interfaces.
   Suggestions
      Add examples of interface usage: Including snippets or pseudocode
         showing how one CSU calls another would enhance clarity.
      Include data formats or types: While control flow is described,
         specifying the data types or structures passed between CSUs would
         improve precision.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths
      Excellent use of pseudocode: Each algorithm is described with
         preconditions, postconditions, side effects, and pseudocode.
      Covers key routines: Includes character selection, undo, player
         joining, input resolution, movement, attacks, and UI focus.
      Unity-specific behavior: Notes on Unity constraints (e.g., main thread
         UI mutations, coroutine serialization) show practical awareness.
   Suggestions
      Add data structure diagrams: Visual representations of key data
         structures (e.g., GameState, SelectedCharacters, _history) would
         aid understanding.
      Clarify edge cases: Some routines (e.g., TrySelectCharacter) could
         benefit from more explicit handling of invalid inputs or race
         conditions.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths
      The document acknowledges that diagrams are in a separate document,
         showing awareness of their importance.
   Suggestions
      Include diagram summaries or references: Even if diagrams are external,
         brief descriptions or references (e.g., "Figure 1: Class
         Relationships") would improve completeness.
      Ensure alignment with textual descriptions: When reviewing the diagram
         document, verify that it matches the classes and interactions
         described in 6.3.1–6.3.3.

Overall Completeness Assessment at the Detailed Design Level
   The document is very complete and well-structured, especially for an Agile
   or Waterfall SDD. It:
      Clearly defines all CSCs and CSUs.
      Provides detailed class and method descriptions.
      Includes interaction and data structure explanations.
      Uses Unity-specific terminology and lifecycle methods effectively.
