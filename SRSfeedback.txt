=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
====================
Very nice introduction and great work on the CSCI breakdown section.  Just
the right amount of detail there for someone at management level to get the
idea of your application without having to dig through details.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
========================
Strengths:
   Clear decomposition by CSC: UI & Menu, Gameplay, and Content &
      Persistence are well-defined.
   Detailed feature coverage:
      UI: Main menu, character and map selection, settings, HUD,
         pause/resume, accessibility options.
      Gameplay: Movement, combat, blocking, special moves, KO logic,
         round/match rules, arena loading.
      Content & Persistence: Character roster, arenas, local profiles,
         settings persistence, asset availability.
      Accessibility: Includes basic accessibility options (readable themes,
         legible text sizes).
      Traceability: Requirements are structured with IDs and grouped
         logically for testing.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Error handling: No explicit requirements for invalid inputs, corrupted
      save files, or failed asset loads.
   Multiplayer support: Requirements assume single-player vs AI; no mention
      of future scalability for multiplayer.
   Security: No mention of protecting local data from tampering.
   Notifications: Limited to match events; lacks functional requirements
      for alerts or onboarding guidance.
   Customization: No requirements for user-defined key bindings beyond
      basic control mapping.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
Strengths:
   Quantifiable metrics provided:
      Frame rate: 60 FPS with frame-time limits.
      Input latency: =100 ms.
      Startup and load times: =5 s for main menu, =4 s for arena load.
      Pause/resume: =250 ms.
   Memory footprint: =800 MB average, =1.2 GB peak.
   Disk size: =1.5 GB.
   Extended play stability: Specifies no crashes or frame degradation
      over 2 hours.
   Responsiveness: UI navigation and audio latency targets included.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Stress/load testing: No requirements for performance under heavy asset
      usage or extended sessions beyond 2 hours.
   Network considerations: Offline mode is noted, but no metrics for
      potential online features.
   Recovery performance: Missing time limits for restoring state after
      crashes.
   Mobile optimization: Targets only Windows PCs; no mention of
      portability.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
Strengths:
   Development environment: Hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU), software stack
      (Unity LTS, Visual Studio, GitHub), art tools (GIMP, Blender),
      and version control are clearly listed.
   Execution environment: Minimum hardware specs (dual-core CPU, 4 GB RAM,
      integrated graphics), OS (Windows 10/11), and input devices.
   Additional considerations: Accessibility, offline operation, and disk
      footprint are addressed.

Gaps / Suggestions:
   Testing environment: No explicit requirements for automated testing
      tools or QA processes.
   Security environment: No mention of secure coding practices or runtime
      integrity checks.
   Monitoring and logging: No requirements for error tracking or analytics.
   Future scalability: No guidance for supporting other platforms or higher
      resolutions.

   Preliminary Schedule                2/2   Gantt chart is a bit sparse
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus

Overall Assessment
   Functional requirements: Strong coverage of core gameplay and UI, but
      missing error handling, security, multiplayer extensibility, and
      advanced customization.
   Performance requirements: Well-defined and measurable, but lacks
      stress/load testing and recovery metrics.
   Environmental requirements: Adequate for development and execution
      basics, but missing testing, security, and monitoring details.
   Your Gantt chart schedule is a bit sparse, so for the next iteration
      you should try to put more of the tasks in there and give a little
      better idea of how long each one will take.  Also, the flow should
      be from top to bottom as you move through the tasks ~ you have them
      bottom to top.


Make sure you incorporate all the suggestions into the document by the end
of the semester for full credit on this deliverable.

Very good job on this deliverable.
