4.1-Plan Introduction Section
  Our project is a fighting 2D pirate game. We wanted to create this game because creating games is all something we are interested in and we wanted to create 
  something easy to play for even people that dont't often play games. Our schedule or "gameplan" goes as follows.
  Week 4: Have a menu screen that works and is straightforward that looks good
  Week 8: The characters can move, fight, block, jump, etc.
  Week 10: The different maps are complete and usable
  Week 12: Make it all work together
  Week 15: Have it so that the characters all have a special move that works
  Week 17: Game is complete and finalized so that we can all test it/play it.
